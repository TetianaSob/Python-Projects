# Copy and Reverse Solution
# copy_and_reverse  is very similar to the previous exercise, copy , except that we reverse the text using a slice before we write it to the new file:

def copy_and_reverse(file_name, new_file_name):
    with open(file_name) as file:
        text = file.read()
 
    with open(new_file_name, "w") as new_file:
        new_file.write(text[::-1])

copy_and_reverse('story.txt', 'story_copy2.txt')
